# Phishing-Analysis

	Conducted a phishing analysis provided by blueteamlabs.
-	The first task was to grab some basic information from the email, such as what time the email was sent, who the recipient is, and what the email is about.
-	After gathering a basic analysis, I proceeded to use specific techniques to gather the originating IP pertaining to the attachment that was provided with the email. Then, utilize an open-source reverse DNS lookup tool to determine the IP's URL originator.
-	I then proceeded to attach the URL to a tool called URL2PNG to get a live screenshot of where the domain takes you.
As well as other tools such as Virus Total and Browserling.

	Results.
-	After finding the originating URL and utilizing URL2PNG, I discovered the website was removed. The best practice is still for the tenant you are attending to block that URL because it can come back live and further any malicious actions it pleases.
